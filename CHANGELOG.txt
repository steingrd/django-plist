Changelog
=========

0.6 - 2010-05-20
----------------
- Do not serialize private model fields. Fixes bug introduced with multi
  database support in Django 1.2.
- PropertyListSerializationFailedError now sends a meaningful message to
  Exception.__init__ to make stacktraces useful when debugging.

0.5 - 2010-01-19
----------------
- Added as_plist keyword argument to render_array shortcut to control 
  serialization of objects without altering Model classes, see updated
  documentation in docs/overview.markdown.
- Tests: Added test suites for shortcut functions and generic views
- Tests: Added Cocoa integration tests in cocoa_tests/. These require a 
  functional GCC/Cocoa suite to run.
- Bug: Dictionary keys are now properly escaped as #PCDATA
- Bug: render_dictionary() rendered None as a string. None is now
  rendered as an empty dictionary.
- Bug: datetime.datetime objects should not output fractions of seconds.
- Bug: datetime.date objects should render with T00:00:00, Cocoa fails to 
  read the property list otherwise.

  <date>HH:MM:SS</date> elements.

0.4 - 2009-10-29
----------------
- Added missing files to Manifest.in which caused build errors when installing
  with setup.py

0.3 - 2009-10-28
----------------

  does not have a as_plist() method or is not a basic type.
